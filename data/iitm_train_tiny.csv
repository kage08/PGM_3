Owing to the length of the discussion  we urge readers to watch the full proceedings of the Soapbox on the SECC Youtube channel here. As per standard Soapbox procedure  the candidates presented their manifestos and corresponding visions for Sports in the Institute. There was a moderate turnout for the soapbox  with supporters encouraging and cheering their candidates.The first presentation was that of Vijaya Bhaskar’s  who began by elucidating his vision. He believed that there were three categories of students in the campus  ranging from experienced sportsmen to absolute beginners; his vision was to create a platform where the latter could eventually become an institute team player  which he believed could be achieved by providing the right kind of practice to the right player. Vijaya Bhaskar believed that infrastructure to facilitate such training was of key importance. Hence  he pointed out that it was essential to improve the hostel facilities  so that even beginners were given a platform to practice and explore since right now  institute courts were reserved for the team players and NSO members. He believed that the facilities which needed repair had to be identified first  and a budget for the same had to be passed in the hostel GBM. In order to maintain the awareness of sports in the institute  Vijaya Bhaskar pointed out that all information  ranging from PoR details  to contact credentials of sports representatives  had to be available on one single site. Vijaya Bhaskar strongly believed in tapping into the new talent that arrived in the institute. Creating awareness amongst the new students was of paramount importance  which could be achieved through freshie orientations  on-ground orientations  motivational talks etc. He suggested new initiatives such as an All-Star game on National Sports Day (29th August) and a Racquethlon (Combination of Table tennis  Squash  Badminton and Tennis). He also listed the shortcomings in the Institute sports facilities and promised to work on them.
