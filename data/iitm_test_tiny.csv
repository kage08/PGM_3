She emphasised on the need to celebrate sports history in orders to inspire other students to join. She sought to do that through compilations of Inter-IIT match highlights on social media  sharing tales of Inter-IIT (that are currently restricted to the sports community) through The Fifth Estate and Chennai 36 by the SOC PR team  media coverage of Shroetor  creation of a wall of fame in SAC to showcase Inter-IIT silverware  legacy exhibits that display a particular team’s logo  motto and tallies  insti book of records that will document both sport and fitness records  and digitized record keeping of scorecards and ladder systems.

In order to achieve all the initiatives listed in her manifest  Keerthana explained her strategy that involved restructuring SOC and redefining the responsibilities of clubs such that they stay in the sports system even beyond her tenure as sports secretary  if she were to be elected. She listed the different representatives and teams under SOC and mentioned that their additional responsibilities are listed in her manifesto. Club responsibilities will primarily be to make new students take up the sport and conduct competitive and non-competitive events. A clear demarcation of responsibilities between the club convenor and the captain will be made at the beginning of the tenure.
The northeast monsoon having failed to replenish Chennai‘s reservoirs  the city is staring at yet another  perhaps worse  water crisis after 2017. Before the beginning of this year  Chennai was facing a rainfall deficit of 24%  which has now risen to over 54%. As of January  less than 14% of water was available in water resources in and around the city.Though the primary cause of this crisis is the diminished rainfall  officials of World Resources Institute (India) have conceded that poor demand management has significantly contributed to the development of this condition. “When the supply is more  consumption pattern changes causing overconsumption”  stated a Senior Project Officer  WRI India. Over the years  utilization of water resources has been steadily increasing for irrigation  domestic and industrial uses. No significant steps have been taken so far to rejuvenate the reservoirs  nor has there been planning based on future water needs. Professor and Officiating Director S Janakarajan from Madras Institute of Developmental Studies pointed out that Madras has had water crises in the past despite good monsoons. “Chennai does not have a long term strategy to deal with water crises. We solely depend upon two or three reservoirs and we think that we are well off to deal with the summer season” he complained.Owing to the scarcity  CMWSSB has been able to supply only 650 MLD (million litres per day)  against the city’s demand of 850 MLD. The fact that this number is likely to dwindle further into the summer is worrying water officials.
