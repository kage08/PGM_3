The Institute Sports Secretary Soapbox was held on the second day of the Institute Soapboxes. The candidates contesting this year for the position of the Institute Sports Secretary are Kishore Yadav and Vijaya Bhaskar. Hemanth Hariharan and Kaushik Viswanath report. Owing to the length of the discussion  we urge readers to watch the full proceedings of the Soapbox on the SECC Youtube channel here. As per standard Soapbox procedure  the candidates presented their manifestos and corresponding visions for Sports in the Institute. There was a moderate turnout for the soapbox  with supporters encouraging and cheering their candidates.The first presentation was that of Vijaya Bhaskar’s  who began by elucidating his vision. He believed that there were three categories of students in the campus  ranging from experienced sportsmen to absolute beginners; his vision was to create a platform where the latter could eventually become an institute team player  which he believed could be achieved by providing the right kind of practice to the right player. Vijaya Bhaskar believed that infrastructure to facilitate such training was of key importance. Hence  he pointed out that it was essential to improve the hostel facilities  so that even beginners were given a platform to practice and explore since right now  institute courts were reserved for the team players and NSO members. He believed that the facilities which needed repair had to be identified first  and a budget for the same had to be passed in the hostel GBM. In order to maintain the awareness of sports in the institute  Vijaya Bhaskar pointed out that all information  ranging from PoR details  to contact credentials of sports representatives  had to be available on one single site. Vijaya Bhaskar strongly believed in tapping into the new talent that arrived in the institute. Creating awareness amongst the new students was of paramount importance  which could be achieved through freshie orientations  on-ground orientations  motivational talks etc. He suggested new initiatives such as an All-Star game on National Sports Day (29th August) and a Racquethlon (Combination of Table tennis  Squash  Badminton and Tennis). He also listed the shortcomings in the Institute sports facilities and promised to work on them. Vijaya Bhaskar also presented the previous Inter IIT statistics to draw attention to the fact that IIT Madras had not been in top form in the past few years. He also promised to bring about a major change in his regard. As far as his feasibility report was concerned  he agreed that it was only theoretical and only based on oral consent from Dean students and Sports advisor  and that the financial  operational and schedule feasibility had to be verified.
He moved on to propose infrastructural advancements such as replacing old gym equipments with new ones and installing wooden badminton and basketball courts. He proposed the introduction of ropes for easy recognition of boundaries  digital display boards in place of the existing analog display boards and lights to enable the use of Chemplast cricket ground at night. He sought to improve the quality of grass on fields  install boundaries (through fencing) around the hockey field and construct washrooms near football and hockey ground. He ended with a proposal to improve lighting and revise timings of Manohar C Watsa stadium. First position in the 41st KVS Regional Sports Meet – Cricket  Mumbai Region was listed as his only credential at the end of the presentation. With more people trickling in  crowd support increased as Shrinath Bhat  a third-year undergraduate student  began his presentation with his vision of bringing in a conducive and inviting environment for students to ensure inclusivity accessibility  and transparency. With regard to inclusivity  he proposed the introduction of gymming and fitness club  women’s powerlifting and para powerlifting competitions  exclusive football and cricket camps for women  splitting of NSO program into two batches  certified programme for postgraduate students  a channel for PG students to practise along with NSO UG students and an institute-wide MADrush race. In order to streamline activities and systems  Shrinath proposed the creation of a grievance management portal to collect grievances and suggestions  earmarking of Tuesdays and Fridays as Sports Days of the Week (and organising sessions accordingly)  digital certificates for all sporting related events and a lending system for non-marking shoes. Under his ‘Nurture’ initiatives were incentives such as Institute Orange Tag and refreshments during morning sessions  introduction of an elective course to handle game pressure and designing of nutrition charts and workshops by dieticians.
Before the crisis began  the institute was receiving a supply of 2 million litres a day from the metro  of which about 0.4 million litres were recycled for reuse. This is done by the Sewage Treatment plant set up near Research Park road. The institute also taps its lake reservoirs  providing us with about 0.3 million litres a day. Summing up  the institute had a potential pool of about 2.7 million litres a day – sufficient to cater to the campus’ daily needs. As February inched closer and the city succumbed to its misfortune of inadequacy  the supply to our campus was drastically reduced by over 60%. The supply of water since has been rather irregular. Water is currently being supplied to the institute by the metro in two rounds a day: 5 AM and 5 PM or 8 AM and 8 PM. However  water isn’t always received at the said times  and quite often  we don’t receive any water at all. We received an average of only 0.4 million litres from metro over the previous two weeks. Moreover  we received absolutely zero water from the metro during the second weekend of this month. About 0.3 MLD is being procured through lorries and about 0.2 to 0.3 MLD from the lakes. The Sewage Treatment Plant recycles about the same amount as before. This sums to about 1.3 MLD  which is only about 6.5% of the campus’ requirement. “The water that is procured is supplied equally to all hostels”  says Nihal  the Hostel Affairs Secretary. “How long the water lasts in a hostel depends on how carefully the residents use it”  he added. Going by our calculation  each of the 20 hostels receives about 65 000 litres a day. The usage pattern of each residential zone differs and varies drastically over time. In emergency situations  some hostels have to be provided more water as compared to others. In general  hostels with more residents use up water faster than others. “We always have 3 lorries of water ready  in case emergency situations arise”  said Nihal  when asked about measures that have been taken to address any emergency situations that may arise. It is at the hostel General Secretary’s discretion to take up the initiative and request for one of these lorries  in case the said hostel is in dire need of the resource. The contacts are available at every local hostel office. In particular  Godavari and Sarayu were hard hit last weekend. Having spoken to Godavari’s hostel legislator  it was known that the hostel did not receive any water for the entirety of Saturday evening. The officials had to contact the Engineering unit for help  who provided the residents with a water tanker to temporarily satisfy their needs. Reportedly  not many tankers were available at the moment  which is why they were incapable of supplying through the overhead tanks to the taps.
Earlier this semester  the plumbing system of Godavari was under maintenance. The legislator informed the correspondent that one of the overhead tanks still isn’t working properly  and that the authorities have promised to get it fixed by Wednesday. Currently  the work is under progress. The hostel is still facing issues with availability of water  but not as much as it faced on Sunday.While Godavari had an ill maintained tank  Sarayu’s pump gave up. The hostel General Secretary informed the correspondent that the hostel hadn’t been receiving water all through Sunday and for a short period on Monday. As the water level from where water was pumped into the tank reduced  the pump was unable to supply any water overhead. A tanker was requested for the residents who carried water for their needs in buckets. As of now  water is limited but the tank is opened up at peak hours.
The groundwater levels in Chennai have gone down by an average 1 to 1.5 meters since July last year. The average groundwater levels this year have been at about 7.6 meters below ground level  against 5.7 meters in December 2017. About 70% of the wells have gone dry this year  compared to only 25% in 2017.Officials have observed alarming dips in groundwater levels across various locations in the city. Places like T Nagar  Triplicane  Choolaimedu and Maduravoyal have had more than a meter’s dip. At other places including Adyar  Ashok Nagar and Vadapalani  the reservoirs have become bone dry.
There are about 3600 water bodies in Kanchipuram  Chennai and Tiruvallur that are facing a deficit. Satellite imagery of the Chembarambakkam lake shows the reduction in its levels in 2017 and 2019.Chennai administration is working towards identification of new quarries and lakes that will help reduce the blow of water scarcity in the upcoming months. Currently  a new quarry in Erumaiyur has been identified and pipelines are being laid from the same to Chembarambakkam to Water Treatment plants so as to maintain supply to the city. About 13 lakes have been surveyed around the city  of which 3 have been identified as potential reservoirs for tapping water this summer. Two desalination plants will be operated in the city to meet its demands. However  in the process of supplying water to the city  the desalination plants inflict substantial damage to the marine ecosystem  making them only a temporary measure.Although the situation this year is worse than what was in 2016  officials assert that they are better prepared to handle the crisis than last time. “We will have more sources of water now than we had in 2017 because we will have water from Veeranam reservoir (fed by Mettur dam) due to resolution of the Cauvery water dispute and the water levels in Kandaleri reservoir (fed by river Krishna) is better than that in 2017″ said a senior official from CMWSSB. “Once the monsoon season is officially over  the restrictions placed on usage by CMWSSB will be back”  he added.
Multi-storey building with a synthetic badminton court  table tennis court and a new gym  a sand track for strength and and endurance-building and portable cricket nets in the stadium  vending machines for snacks and refreshments in Gymkhana and SAC and arrangement of a discount system in all sports outlets around insti were his infrastructural initiatives. Under outreach  Shrinath proposed the creation of a YouTube channel exclusive for IIT-M sports  introduction of a Web-Ops team under Sports Organising Committee that would handle his initiatives in and maintenance of the sports website  creation of an alumni sports donation portal and database to receive donations inn the sporting sphere  exclusive T-shirt sales as a branding initiative for different sporting clubs and a collaboration with US-based EUSAI to commercialise sports  bring in free merchandise and live-stream matches.He concluded with his credentials – Hostel Sports Secretary (Godavari Hostel)  Finance Core  Sports Organising Committee  Institute Athletics Convenor  Media Coordinator  Inter-IIt Sports Meet and Saarang and the title of Mr. NSO – and signed off to a cheering crowd.
Rohan Lal  an MS Scholar from the Department of Electrical Engineering was the first to present. Calling the state of affairs of sports in insti quite good  he went to present his initiatives to make it better. He proposed to introduce Kabaddi  Kick Volleyball  Pool Table games  Kho-Kho and a horse-riding club in the institute. He talked about risks that skaters face when they practise alongside footballers in rush hours and proposed to create a safe practising environment for them. He also proposed online and offline booking of sports fields and courts slot-wise  training sessions for new learners and all other students. To improve the hostel sports scene  he talked about meeting hostel sports secretaries regularly and having a transparent selection procedure for tournaments and a feedback mechanism to improve events.
