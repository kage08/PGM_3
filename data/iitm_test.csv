In order to achieve all the initiatives listed in her manifest  Keerthana explained her strategy that involved restructuring SOC and redefining the responsibilities of clubs such that they stay in the sports system even beyond her tenure as sports secretary  if she were to be elected. She listed the different representatives and teams under SOC and mentioned that their additional responsibilities are listed in her manifesto. Club responsibilities will primarily be to make new students take up the sport and conduct competitive and non-competitive events. A clear demarcation of responsibilities between the club convenor and the captain will be made at the beginning of the tenure.
While the city is reeling under the drought  our campus has an inspirational story to tell. In January 2017  our institute commissioned a state of the art 4 MLD (max capacity) sewage treatment plant (STP) armed with the latest Sequential Batch Reactor technology. The system was developed over a course of 3 years  with a costing of about INR 20 crore. This plant is capable of ameliorating raw sewage water to potable standards. A fully automatic Treated Water Distribution System is in place with 20 km long pipelines connected to every household  hostel and academic complex. The treated water conforms to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) norms and also has extra UV filtration and ozonation systems. The government has given its nod to CMWSSB to replicate IITM’s successful model of ‘recycling and reusing’ sewage water to rejuvenate water bodies. The officials admitted that they are frantically looking for measures to rejuvenate the water bodies  considering the fact that they are only at 14% of their capacity. The sewage water will be treated in an STP similar that we have here and then will be discharged into lakes. They hope recharge groundwater and also create a sustainable source this way. Reportedly  the state administration has sanctioned a sum of INR 86 crore for this supply augmentation project.
The northeast monsoon having failed to replenish Chennai‘s reservoirs  the city is staring at yet another  perhaps worse  water crisis after 2017. Before the beginning of this year  Chennai was facing a rainfall deficit of 24%  which has now risen to over 54%. As of January  less than 14% of water was available in water resources in and around the city.Though the primary cause of this crisis is the diminished rainfall  officials of World Resources Institute (India) have conceded that poor demand management has significantly contributed to the development of this condition. “When the supply is more  consumption pattern changes causing overconsumption”  stated a Senior Project Officer  WRI India. Over the years  utilization of water resources has been steadily increasing for irrigation  domestic and industrial uses. No significant steps have been taken so far to rejuvenate the reservoirs  nor has there been planning based on future water needs. Professor and Officiating Director S Janakarajan from Madras Institute of Developmental Studies pointed out that Madras has had water crises in the past despite good monsoons. “Chennai does not have a long term strategy to deal with water crises. We solely depend upon two or three reservoirs and we think that we are well off to deal with the summer season” he complained.Owing to the scarcity  CMWSSB has been able to supply only 650 MLD (million litres per day)  against the city’s demand of 850 MLD. The fact that this number is likely to dwindle further into the summer is worrying water officials.
It is very likely that water supply will collapse further in the upcoming days. The institute will rely majorly on ‘grey water’  which is what recycled water from the sewage treatment plant is called. When asked whether it is a wise choice to stay in the campus during the upcoming summer  HAS deferred commenting. However  there are certain basic measures that the hostelers (or any other residents) should undertake in order to conserve as much water as possible.
There are about 3600 water bodies in Kanchipuram  Chennai and Tiruvallur that are facing a deficit. Satellite imagery of the Chembarambakkam lake shows the reduction in its levels in 2017 and 2019.Chennai administration is working towards identification of new quarries and lakes that will help reduce the blow of water scarcity in the upcoming months. Currently  a new quarry in Erumaiyur has been identified and pipelines are being laid from the same to Chembarambakkam to Water Treatment plants so as to maintain supply to the city. About 13 lakes have been surveyed around the city  of which 3 have been identified as potential reservoirs for tapping water this summer. Two desalination plants will be operated in the city to meet its demands. However  in the process of supplying water to the city  the desalination plants inflict substantial damage to the marine ecosystem  making them only a temporary measure.Although the situation this year is worse than what was in 2016  officials assert that they are better prepared to handle the crisis than last time. “We will have more sources of water now than we had in 2017 because we will have water from Veeranam reservoir (fed by Mettur dam) due to resolution of the Cauvery water dispute and the water levels in Kandaleri reservoir (fed by river Krishna) is better than that in 2017″ said a senior official from CMWSSB. “Once the monsoon season is officially over  the restrictions placed on usage by CMWSSB will be back”  he added.
The groundwater levels in Chennai have gone down by an average 1 to 1.5 meters since July last year. The average groundwater levels this year have been at about 7.6 meters below ground level  against 5.7 meters in December 2017. About 70% of the wells have gone dry this year  compared to only 25% in 2017.Officials have observed alarming dips in groundwater levels across various locations in the city. Places like T Nagar  Triplicane  Choolaimedu and Maduravoyal have had more than a meter’s dip. At other places including Adyar  Ashok Nagar and Vadapalani  the reservoirs have become bone dry.
The Institute Sports Secretary Soapbox was held on the second day of the Institute Soapboxes. The candidates contesting this year for the position of the Institute Sports Secretary are Kishore Yadav and Vijaya Bhaskar. Hemanth Hariharan and Kaushik Viswanath report. Owing to the length of the discussion  we urge readers to watch the full proceedings of the Soapbox on the SECC Youtube channel here. As per standard Soapbox procedure  the candidates presented their manifestos and corresponding visions for Sports in the Institute. There was a moderate turnout for the soapbox  with supporters encouraging and cheering their candidates.The first presentation was that of Vijaya Bhaskar’s  who began by elucidating his vision. He believed that there were three categories of students in the campus  ranging from experienced sportsmen to absolute beginners; his vision was to create a platform where the latter could eventually become an institute team player  which he believed could be achieved by providing the right kind of practice to the right player. Vijaya Bhaskar believed that infrastructure to facilitate such training was of key importance. Hence  he pointed out that it was essential to improve the hostel facilities  so that even beginners were given a platform to practice and explore since right now  institute courts were reserved for the team players and NSO members. He believed that the facilities which needed repair had to be identified first  and a budget for the same had to be passed in the hostel GBM. In order to maintain the awareness of sports in the institute  Vijaya Bhaskar pointed out that all information  ranging from PoR details  to contact credentials of sports representatives  had to be available on one single site. Vijaya Bhaskar strongly believed in tapping into the new talent that arrived in the institute. Creating awareness amongst the new students was of paramount importance  which could be achieved through freshie orientations  on-ground orientations  motivational talks etc. He suggested new initiatives such as an All-Star game on National Sports Day (29th August) and a Racquethlon (Combination of Table tennis  Squash  Badminton and Tennis). He also listed the shortcomings in the Institute sports facilities and promised to work on them. Vijaya Bhaskar also presented the previous Inter IIT statistics to draw attention to the fact that IIT Madras had not been in top form in the past few years. He also promised to bring about a major change in his regard. As far as his feasibility report was concerned  he agreed that it was only theoretical and only based on oral consent from Dean students and Sports advisor  and that the financial  operational and schedule feasibility had to be verified.
Sports facility was opened but it had some water issues. Thanks to recent water recycling this was fixed.

About 70% of the wells have gone dry this year  compared to only 25% in 2017.Officials have observed alarming dips in groundwater levels the institute was receiving a supply of 2 million litres a day The supply of water since has been rather irregular. Water is currently being supplied to the institute by the metro in two rounds a day: 5 AM and 5 PM or 8 AM and 8 PM. However  water isn’t always received at the said times  and quite often  we don’t receive any water at all. We received an average of only 0.4 million litres from metro over the previous two weeks. Moreover  we received absolutely zero water from the metro during the second weekend of this month. About 0.3 MLD is being procured through lorries and about 0.2 to 0.3 MLD from the lakes. The Sewage Treatment Plant recycles about the same amount as before. This sums to about 1.3 MLD  which is only about 6.5% of the campus’ requirement. “The water that is procured is supplied equally to all hostels”  says Nihal  the Hostel Affairs Secretary. “How long the water lasts in a hostel depends on how carefully the residents use it”  he added.
